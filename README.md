## How to download
The most up-to-date version of the application is located under "builds/_current" as a ".exe" (recommended) or a ".jar" .
Simply select the file and press the "Download" button to start downloading (a warning may pop up before/during the download. This is perfectly normal behaviour for modern browsers, however the application itself is not harmful to your computer in any way. Source code is available for those inclined).

Older builds of the application also exists in the "builds" folder, these are however not recommended as they can be unstable and/or buggy.
