# Rating Reader
Rating Reader is a Windows application that reads media scores along with other useful information from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) and conveniently displays them for you in a spoiler-free way.

It functions by parsing the IMDb HTML website code through the library [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup). 
The IMDb website is constantly changing, 
which means Rating Reader will eventually stop working since it won't be able to read their new fancy HTML code.
In that case, and if I have time, I will update the application to work on their new HTML.
* Is working as of: **2022-03-26**.

**Note:** 
* Needs an internet connection to work (obviously).
* Developed, tested, and working on Windows 10. Functionality for other platforms or Windows versions is unknown.

## How to download
You can run the application either through the runnable .jar or .exe. 
The most recent version of both files can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/sam-salek/RatingReader/releases/).
* A recent JRE needs to be installed to run the .jar.
* The .exe **must always** be located in the same directory as the included "win32" folder to be able to run. You can create a shortcut of the .exe and place it wherever you need for easier access.
