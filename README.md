Rating Reader is an application that reads media scores from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) and conveniently displays them in a spoiler-free way. 
Needs an internet connection to work.

## How to download
The most up-to-date version of RatingReader.exe is located under "builds/_current", a .jar version of the application also exists in the same place for those inclined.
Simply select the file and press the "Download" button to start downloading (a warning may pop up before/during the download. This is perfectly normal, however the application itself is not harmful to your computer in any way. The source code is always available if skeptical).
Older builds also exist beside the "_current" folder, these are however not recommended as they can be unstable and/or buggy.
